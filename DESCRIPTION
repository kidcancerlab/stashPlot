Description: A package to stash and manage plot objects with metadata, allowing
    easy reloading, modification, and assembly of plots. This package is
    designed to help manage the complexity of creating and modifying plots in
    R, especially when the plots are created in multiple steps or when the
    plots are created by multiple people. The package provides a way to save
    plot objects to disk, along with metadata about the plot. The package also
    provides a way to reload the plot objects and metadata so one can modify the
    plots and assemble the plots into a final plot. The package is designed to
    work with the 'ggplot2' package, but it can be used with other plotting
    packages as well.
